# PdfMerge

A little tool to merge the two PDF files created when scanning a two sided document using the automatic document feeder.

Just give it the full path to both files and you are good to go!

It assumes that the even pages will be in reverse order, which is what happens when you just flip the stack of pages and shove it in the ADF.
